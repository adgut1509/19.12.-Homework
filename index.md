His goal is to use Labvanced to record an online study on psychology with human participants. He has used other online research software, but his computer knowledge is quite limited. He is eager to learn, confident in his abilities, and not stressed (he is a psychologist, so he knows how to deal with that).

He will use a user manual, which will be available on the university's website and targeted at the university's employees who need to know how to use Labvanced but do not have much experience/knowledge with similar software. Particular steps will be covered in separate sections.

The following is a section on how to publish and record a study in Labvanced.

Now you should see the requirements to publish and record a study. By default, the study design is valid, and you are its owner. To fulfil the requirements, first, click on the icon next to *Description: No keyword(s), No affiliation*.

In this section, you need to do two things:
1. Add at least one keyword. To do it, click on the keyword that you want to add in the drop-down menu in the *Keywords* section.
2. In the *Author or Affiliation* section, write your name or the name of the institution you are affiliated with.

Here you can also set the minimum and maximum duration of your study and give it a description. However, that is not obligatory.
